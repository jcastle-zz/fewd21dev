<br>

---


###Description


The goal of this first assignement is to identify the different parts of content and apply structure to it. The starter content is an excerpt from Wikipedia's article on the Xia Dynasty of China.  Take this content and apply the appropriate HTML and then give it some basic styling.

There are a few tags already in the content to help with style applications. Take a look at these tags. What do they do?

Styling Suggestions:
- Make the paragraph text the font "Georgia"
- Make the text the color #05080C
- Make the 1st level of the table of contents larger than the second level
- Make the 2nd level of the table of contents the color #3344aa
- Make the H1's all uppercase

###Resources

The original wiki page that this article was taken from is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty.  The HTML that wikipedia uses will be fairly different and more complex than is ideal for the homework.  Feel free to use it for visual ideas.
