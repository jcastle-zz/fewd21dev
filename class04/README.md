###Week 4 Intro To Programming

This week we set the stage for students to create interactive apps. Students will continue to add to their understanding in the following 3 weeks.

The main project and homework this week is to create interactivity on Relaxr's blog by hiding and showing content on click events. See the assignment [here](Assignment).  

Next week, students will also be required to hand in wireframes for their final projects. You can ask students to create wireframes using tools like [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/), [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) or just plain old pen and paper. If you ask students to use wireframing software, you may want to provide a breif tutorial in class this week.
