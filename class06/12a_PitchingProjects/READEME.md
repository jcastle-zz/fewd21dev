###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

The goal of this lesson is to provide practice both presenting concepts to a team and providing constructive analysis of proposed projects.

#####Lab: Project Pitch

| Exercise | No solution file|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 45 min | 
| __Topics__ | Wireframing, analysis, project planning | 
| __Description__| Students will be broken into teams of at least 4 and given whiteboard markers. Each of them will have to present their final project concept to the rest of the team. Their goal is to convince the team that their project is:
* Technologially achievable
* Has required content available (for example: if this is a portfolio project, what pieces go in? are there enough examples? Is the intended layout appropriate for the number of pieces?
* Is resonable with the number of resources available
The students listening to the presentation must be able to identify both the strengths of the idea and identify possible risk factors to success of the project.
