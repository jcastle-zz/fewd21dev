Box Model

Inline vs Block
- code{} = inline elements
- inline{} = display to create a tabbed menu

Reset and Normalize
- Normalize.css - add to HTML as css before style css to assist with making cross browser capatable

Tags
- Span = apply style to small piece of text
- DIV = block level version of a span
- Class and ID = class should be a grouping and start with consonant; IDs are unique, not good for CSS, more for anchors and JS (.classname vs #idname)
- New HTML5 elements - header, footer, aside
- Float = moving elements around the page

*Remove tags with Normalize or Rest (reset takes out everything, normalize leaves some tags)
