###Week 7 - Multiple Screens

This week we teach students how to make websites responsive. This will bring the focus back to HTML and CSS. We will take a break from learning new JS topics this week; however, students will use what they've already learned about JavaScript to add a hidden navigation bar in the mobile version of Startup Matchmaker.

The goal for this week is to walk students through the responsive design process.

###Final Project Milestone 2

By week 7, you should have submitted psuedo code and a draft of the HTML/CSS for your application.  This week, you'll focus on drafting the JavaScript and jQuery you'll need for your application.
